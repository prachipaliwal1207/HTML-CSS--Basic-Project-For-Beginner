         <h1> Biography </h1>
         <p>Jamsetji (Jamshedji) Nusserwanji Tata (3 March 1839 – 19 May 1904) was an Indian pioneer industrialist who founded the Tata Group, India's biggest conglomerate company. Named the greatest philanthropist of the last century by several polls and ranking lists, he also established the city of Jamshedpur.
            Jamshedji Tata is regarded as the legendary "Father of Indian Industry".He was so influential in the world of industry that Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Tata as a One-Man Planning Commission.
            Tata, who in his early life was a merchant, went on to change the business world of India through his many ventures within the cotton and pig iron industry, and is known as one of the most important builders of the modern Indian economy. Out of his many achievements, Tata is particularly notable for the Tata Iron and Steel Works company in Jamshedpur.
            Tata was ranked first in the "Hurun Philanthropists of the Century" (2021) by total donations of nearly $102.4 billion with the start of his key endowments way back in 1892.
